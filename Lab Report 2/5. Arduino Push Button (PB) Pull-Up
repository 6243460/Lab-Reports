/*
  Goal:
  Reads the state of a push button connected to the Arduino, prints 0 when pressed and 1 when not pressed to the Serial Monitor every 500 milliseconds.
  
  Main Theme: Demonstrates digital input (reading the state of a push button) and Serial.print (printing the button state to the Serial Monitor) with a pull-up resistor.

*/

int pushButton = 2;  // Define the pin number where the push button is connected

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600); // Start serial communication at 9600 bits per second 
  pinMode(pushButton, INPUT); // Set the pushButton pin as an input to read the state of the button
}

void loop() {
  int buttonState = digitalRead(pushButton); // Read the current state of the push button (HIGH or LOW) and store it in 'buttonState'
  Serial.println(buttonState); // Print the current button state to the Serial Monitor (either HIGH or LOW)
  delay(1);  // Wait for 1 milliseconds before the next reading 
}
