/*
  Goal:
  Reads the state of a push button connected to the Arduino, prints 0 when pressed and 1 when not pressed to the Serial Monitor with an internal pull-up resistor.
  
  Main Theme: Demonstrates the use of pinMode(INPUT_PULLUP) and digital input (reading the state of a push button) and Serial.print (printing the button state to the Serial Monitor).
