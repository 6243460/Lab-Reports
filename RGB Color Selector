/*
 * Program Name: RGB Color Selector with One Potentiometer
 * Goal:
 *   This program uses one potentiometer to control the brightness of an RGB LED.
 *   The potentiometer adjusts all three colors (Red, Green, Blue) of the RGB LED simultaneously.
 *   When the potentiometer is turned fully to the left, the LED will be off, and when it is turned
 *   to the right, the LED will be white (all colors on).
 * 
 * Main Theme:
 *   This program demonstrates how to use one potentiometer to control the intensity of an RGB LED.
 *   The potentiometer value controls the brightness of all three color channels (Red, Green, Blue).
 * 
 * Hardware Connections:
 *   - Potentiometer connected to pin A0 (middle pin to A0, outer pins to 5V and GND).
 *   - RGB LED connected to pins 9, 10, 11 (with 220Î© resistors).
