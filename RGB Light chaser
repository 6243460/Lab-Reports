/*
 * Program Name: RGB Light Chaser
 * Goal:
 *   This program controls an RGB LED and creates a light chaser effect.
 *   The RGB LED will light up in a sequence where one color turns on at a time, and it "chases" through red, green, and blue.
 *   The pattern will repeat continuously, with each color staying on for 500 milliseconds.
 * 
 * Main Theme:
 *   The program demonstrates how to control an RGB LED using **digital output** pins and **timing** with the `delay()` function.
 *   It creates a visual effect by changing the colors of the LED in a "chase" sequence.
 * 
 * Hardware Connections:
 *   - RGB LED connected to pins: Red (pin 9), Green (pin 10), and Blue (pin 11)
 *   - Each LED in the RGB is connected to the Arduino through appropriate current-limiting resistors.
