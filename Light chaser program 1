/*
  Goal: 
  Control three LEDs connected to the Arduino, lighting them up in a "chase" pattern where only one LED is on at a time, sequentially moving from one LED to the next, with each LED staying on for 1 second.
 
  Main Theme:
  Controlloing digital output and timing using the delay function to sequentially switch LEDs on and off, creating a light chaser effect.
