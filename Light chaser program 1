   Goal: 
   Controls three LEDs connected to the Arduino. 
   The LEDs will light up in a "chase" pattern where only one LED is on at a time,
   and it moves from one LED to the next in a sequence. Each LED stays on for 1 second.
 
   Main Theme:
   The program demonstrates basic **digital output control** and **timing** using the delay function.
   It uses simple **LED switching** to create a light chaser effect, which is commonly used in visual effects.
 
   Hardware Connections:
   - LED 1 connected to pin 9
   - LED 2 connected to pin 8
   - LED 3 connected to pin 7
   - All LEDs are connected to the Arduino through appropriate resistors to limit current.

void setup() {
  // Set the pins 9, 8, and 7 as output pins for controlling LEDs
  pinMode(9, OUTPUT);  // LED 1
  pinMode(8, OUTPUT);  // LED 2
  pinMode(7, OUTPUT);  // LED 3
}

void loop() {
  // Turn on LED 1 and turn off LEDs 2 and 3
  digitalWrite(9, HIGH);   
  digitalWrite(8, LOW);   
  digitalWrite(7, LOW);    
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1 second

  // Turn on LED 2 and turn off LEDs 1 and 3
  digitalWrite(9, LOW);   
  digitalWrite(8, HIGH);   
  digitalWrite(7, LOW);    
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1 second

  // Turn on LED 3 and turn off LEDs 1 and 2
  digitalWrite(7, HIGH);   
  digitalWrite(8, LOW);   
  digitalWrite(9, LOW);    
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1 second
