/*
 * Program Name: Push Button with Pull-Down
 * Goal:
 *   This program uses an external pull-down resistor to read the state of a push button.
 *   It displays the button's state (pressed or not) as either HIGH or LOW on the Serial Monitor.
 *   When the button is pressed, the value will be HIGH, and when it is released, the value will be LOW.
 * 
 * Main Theme:
 *   The program demonstrates how to use an **external pull-down resistor** with a push button.
 *   The button's state is read using `digitalRead()` and displayed on the **Serial Monitor**.
 * 
 * Hardware Connections:
 *   - The push button is connected between **pin 7** (digital input) and **VCC** (5V).
 *   - A **10kÎ© pull-down resistor** is connected between the **button pin** (pin 7) and **GND**.

    Serial.println("Button Pressed (HIGH)");
  } 
  // If button is not pressed, state will be LOW (pin is pulled to GND by pull-down resistor)
  else {
    Serial.println("Button Not Pressed (LOW)");
  }
  
  delay(500);  // Delay for 500ms before reading the button again
