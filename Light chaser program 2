/*
 * Program Name: LED Pattern Program
 * Goal: 
 *   This program controls four LEDs connected to the Arduino. 
 *   It creates a sequence where the LEDs turn on and off in different patterns.
 *   The program makes the LEDs blink in various combinations, including all on, some on, and all off. 
 *   Each pattern is displayed for a fixed amount of time, defined by the variable 'timewait'.
 * 
 * Main Theme:
 *   The program demonstrates **digital output control** and **timing** using the `delay()` function.
 *   It showcases the concept of controlling multiple LEDs simultaneously to create patterns.
 * 
 * Hardware Connections:
 *   - LED 1 connected to pin 9
 *   - LED 2 connected to pin 8
 *   - LED 3 connected to pin 7
 *   - LED 4 connected to pin 6
 *   - Each LED should be connected through a current-limiting resistor to avoid damage to the LEDs.
